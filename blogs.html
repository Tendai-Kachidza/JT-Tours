				<div class="postcard__preview-txt">Standing as a stoic sentinel at the eastern edge of Stanley Harbour, the Lady Elizabeth shipwreck is one of the Falkland Islands' most poignant and photogenic landmarks. This majestic iron barque, launched in 1879, met its fateful end not in a dramatic sinking at sea, but by being condemned after sustaining damage near Cape Horn in 1913, eventually drifting to its current resting place in Whalebone Cove during a fierce gale in 1936. Today, her rusting skeleton, with masts still reaching towards the sky, creates a striking silhouette against the often-dramatic Falklands sky. A visit to the "Lady Liz" offers a powerful connection to the islands' rich maritime history, evoking tales of arduous voyages and the enduring power of the elements. It's a truly iconic sight, inviting quiet contemplation and capturing the rugged, resilient spirit of the Falklands</div>

This stunning stretch of white sand and clear, shallow waters is less frequented than some other sites, providing a tranquil sanctuary where wildlife thrives undisturbed. Betha's Beach is particularly celebrated for its magnificent King Penguin colony, which often gathers here, offering breathtaking opportunities to observe these majestic birds in their natural splendor, alongside other species like Gentoo and Magellanic penguins. The expansive, undeveloped landscape and the gentle lapping of the waves create an atmosphere of profound peace, making it a perfect spot for quiet reflection, unparalleled wildlife photography, and truly feeling the wild heart of the Falkland Islands.

Located close to Stanley, this breathtaking crescent of shoreline is famous for its thriving colony of Magellanic penguins, whose burrows dot the sandy dunes and whose comical waddle can be observed as they come and go from the turquoise waters. What makes Yorke Bay particularly poignant is its history: once a restricted area due to remaining minefields from the 1982 conflict, it was fully demined and reopened in 2020, marking a powerful moment of reclamation for both nature and the community. Today, it stands as a testament to resilience, offering visitors a safe and incredibly rewarding opportunity to witness abundant birdlife, stroll along the stunning beach, and reflect on the enduring spirit of the Falkland Islands.</div>

Originally created by military personnel, signs have been added by many visitors. It was originally started by British troops stationed on the islands after the Falklands War in 1982. The soldiers created signs with the names of their hometowns and their distances from the Falkland Islands, attaching them to an old power line pylon. 
					This tradition has continued, with visitors, including tourists and scientists, adding their own signs over the years. As a result, the quirky structure now features signs for villages, towns, and cities from various places around the world, including the UK, American continent, Europe, and Russia.</div>

				<div class="postcard__preview-txt">Step back in time as you encounter the delightful Jubilee Villas in Stanley, a charming architectural anomaly that beautifully contrasts with the rest of the capital's more utilitarian design. Built in 1887 to commemorate Queen Victoria's Golden Jubilee, these distinctive terraced townhouses are a striking example of British Victorian architecture. With their traditional brick facades and multi-paned windows, they evoke a strong sense of English heritage, yet are uniquely Falklandian with their often brightly coloured corrugated iron roofs—a practical adaptation to the islands' climate. These historic villas are more than just buildings; they're a living postcard from a bygone era, offering a picturesque glimpse into the enduring connections and historical layers that shape the unique character of Stanley and the Falkland Islands.</div>

					then cleaning , varnishing, gluing and mounting them on stands. This takes around 2,000 hours for each set of bones. He hopes that the display will encourage people to think about the "evils of whaling". Four full skeletons are displayed - a 10m (30ft) Minke whale, a 20m (60ft) Sei whale ,a 4m (12ft) Blackfish (Pilot)
					whale and a 3m (10ft) stranger to Falklands' shores from New Zealand. Also on display are the heads of a sperm whale, a killer whale (orca) and some seals. The whaling gun is from South Georgia and the harpoons are collected over a number of years.

Today the atmosphere is notably peaceful and a small corral protects the graves of the few British soldiers buried on the Islands. The view from Sussex Mountain en-route to San Carlos is one of the best in the Falklands and gives a fantastic perspective of the whole area. Explore the peak, with land-owner permission, to discover look-out shelters.The British military cemetery at San Carlos, often called the Blue Beach Military Cemetery, is a powerful and peaceful site. It's the final resting place for 14 British servicemen who died during the landings and subsequent battles in the San Carlos area. The cemetery overlooks the waters of San Carlos Bay, an area infamously nicknamed "Bomb Alley" by British forces due to the intense air attacks they endured while establishing their beachhead.</div>
